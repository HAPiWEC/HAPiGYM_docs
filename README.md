# HAPiGYM Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the HAPiGYM Software Suite! The tools described in the following form the complete toolset for developing, testing and deploying Wave Energy Converter (WEC) controllers as part of the HAPiGYM experiments. The HAPiGYM concept has been developed as part of a wider project called **HAPiWEC** - please visit https://www.hapiwec.net/ ([EP/V040987/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/V040987/1)) for more information on the project. Details of the HAPiGYM experiments can be found [here](https://www.hapiwec.net/hapigym/).

The software tools have been developed in Matlab and Simulink. For the remote-access stage of the HAPiGYM experiments (i.e. when your controller design is tested remotely in our wave tank facility), interaction with the code will be via Matlab Online.

If you have questions relating to this suite of software tools, please email us (hapiwec@ed.ac.uk) with the subject "HAPiGYM Software Support", or alternatively use the [Contact Us](https://www.hapiwec.net/get-in-touch/) form on our website.
