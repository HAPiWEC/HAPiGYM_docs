# Getting started - Installation

## Toolbox installation

The software is set up as a Matlab Toolbox.

**To install:** Download the most recent version of the toolbox [here](https://github.com/HAPiWEC/HAPiGYM_docs/tree/main/Toolbox_versions). From anywhere inside your operating system's file explorer, or from within Matlab itself, double click the `HAPiGYM.mltbx` file to add the toolbox to your Matlab add-ons.

## Updates

This toolbox is maintained by the HAPiWEC Team - you will be emailed everytime a new version is released. You will need to download and double click the new file to install the latest version.
