# Getting started - Build a model


Now that you've [installed](https://github.com/HAPiWEC/HAPiGYM_docs/blob/main/Pages/1-Installation.md) the HAPiGYM Toolbox and linked to to the OceanEdge Cloud, you can build a model.

Create an empty directory to carry out your work. Open Matlab and move to this path, then run the following 'one-time' setup command in the command line:

```matlab
Hapigym.build_model()
```

You'll now find a folder structure in the present directory. **You should keep the filenames and folder structure unchanged going forward**; this is because the main simulation references components in these folders.
You'll still have well-defined areas that you can build your own code and Simulink models.
