# Updating the toolbox

 **1. Install the latest toolbox version:** This is a repeat of the first quick start step - download and install the [latest toolbox](https://github.com/HAPiWEC/HAPiGYM_docs/tree/main/Toolbox_versions). 

 **2.a) Upgrade Option:** Navigate to the project folder where you've been working and in the Matlab command line type: ```matlab Hapigym.upgrade() ``` 
 
 **2.b) New Project Option:** There might be reasons to start from scratch. Just repeat the instructions in the Quick Start guide.
 
 **3. Check previous file versions:** When you upgrade, any changes that you have made are stored in a new folder called `Previous_versions`. The intension is to save people from Github. We'll monitor the effectiveness of this approach as we go along.
