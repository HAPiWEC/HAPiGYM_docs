# Updating the toolbox

We'll email participants whenever there is a toolbox update available. It's up to you when you do the update - your current toolbox will still work, it just won't have any new features. If the update is terrible, you can always reinstall an older version.  

 **1. Install the latest toolbox version:** This is a repeat of the first quick start step - download and install the [latest toolbox](https://github.com/HAPiWEC/HAPiGYM_docs/tree/main/Toolbox_versions). 

 **2.a) Upgrade Option:** Navigate to the project folder where you've been working and in the Matlab command line type: ```matlab Hapigym.upgrade() ``` 
 
 **2.b) New Project Option:** There might be reasons to start from scratch. Just repeat the instructions in the [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/HAPiWEC/HAPiGYM_docs/blob/main/Pages/1-Quick-Start.md).
 
 **3. Check previous file versions:** When you upgrade, any changes that you have made are stored in a new folder called `Previous_versions`. The intension is to save people from Github. We'll monitor the effectiveness of this approach as we go along.
