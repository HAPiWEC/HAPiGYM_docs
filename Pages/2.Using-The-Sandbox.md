# Getting started - Build a model


Now that you've [installed](https://github.com/HAPiWEC/HAPiGYM_docs/blob/main/Pages/1-Installation.md) the HAPiGYM Toolbox, you can build the project folder for your model.

Create an empty directory to carry out your work. Open Matlab and move to this path, then run the following 'one-time' setup command in the command line:

```matlab
Hapigym.build_model()
```

You'll now find a folder structure in the present directory. **You should keep the filenames and folder structure unchanged going forward**; this is because the main simulation references components in these folders.
You'll still have well-defined areas that you can build your own code and Simulink models.
